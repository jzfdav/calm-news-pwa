- Decision: Use Vite with React, TypeScript, and Vitest for the initial project structure.
- Reason: Vite provides a fast development experience, React is robust for PWA development, and Vitest integrates seamlessly with Vite for unit testing.
- Trade-offs: Adds a build step (TSC/Vite) compared to pure Vanilla JS, but provides better maintainability and type safety for a project intended for long-term use.
