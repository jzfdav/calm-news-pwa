# PHILOSOPHY

## Why This App Exists

This app exists to help me stay informed **without being overwhelmed**.

The goal is not to consume more news.
The goal is to understand what matters — calmly, intentionally, and on my own terms.

I want to be:
- Aware of what is happening in the world
- Up to date in technology
- A responsible citizen
- A present family man

This app serves that purpose — nothing more.

## Core Beliefs

### 1. News Should Respect Attention

Attention is finite.
This app treats attention as a scarce and valuable resource.

There is:
- No infinite scroll
- No autoplay
- No breaking news urgency
- No recommendations designed to hook

If I finish reading the daily digest, I am *done* for the day.

---

### 2. Time-Based, Not Feed-Based

The world does not need to be refreshed every second.

This app is built around **daily understanding**, not real-time updates.
News is gathered continuously, but presented **once per day** in a fixed digest.

What I read today does not change halfway through the day.

---

### 3. Limits Are a Feature

More information does not mean more understanding.

Each section has strict limits on:
- Number of stories
- Frequency of updates
- Visual noise

Constraints are intentional.
They create clarity.

---

### 4. Calm by Default

This app should feel calm to open.

Design choices favor:
- Readability over density
- Space over clutter
- Typography over graphics
- Neutral tone over sensational language

The app should never feel loud.

---

### 5. Ownership Over Algorithms

There is no personalization engine.
There is no engagement optimization.
There is no behavioral tracking.

I choose:
- What sections exist
- Which sources are followed
- When I read

The app does not try to outthink me.

---

### 6. Personal Use Comes First

This app is built for **one user**.

There are:
- No growth goals
- No monetization plans
- No social features
- No analytics beyond basic functionality

If a feature does not clearly improve personal daily use, it does not belong here.

---

### 7. Content Is Not the Product

The product is **the experience of reading**.

The app:
- Respects original sources
- Preserves attribution
- Provides clean access to text
- Allows opening the original article when desired

It does not attempt to replace journalism.

---

### 8. Offline Is a First-Class Citizen

News should be readable:
- Without a network
- Without distractions
- Without delays

Articles, once fetched, should remain available.

---

### 9. No AI by Default

This app does not summarize, rewrite, or reinterpret content by default.

Understanding comes from reading.

If AI is ever used, it must be:
- Explicit
- Optional
- User-initiated
- Non-invasive

---

## What This App Is Not

This app is not:
- A social network
- A real-time alert system
- A recommendation engine
- A content platform
- A dopamine machine

---

## A Simple Test for Every Feature

Before adding anything, ask:

> Does this help me stay informed, calm, and present?

If the answer is not a clear **yes**, the feature does not belong here.

---

## End State

When I open this app and reach the end of the daily digest, I should feel:

> “I know enough for today.”

And then I close it.
