# New Calm Project

A personal, calm-first application built for clarity, intention, and long-term use.

This project prioritizes:
- Readability over features
- Ownership over algorithms
- Time-based interaction over infinite feeds
- Calm UX over engagement tricks

There are no growth goals.
There is no monetization.
There is no pressure to ship fast.

This is software built for one user — intentionally.
